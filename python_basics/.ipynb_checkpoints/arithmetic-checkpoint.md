# Arithmetic
The basic arithmetic operations are
```
2+3
2-3
2*3
2/3
2**3
```
Python understands the order of operations.
- `12/2/3` yields `2.0`, computed as 12 divided by 2, then divided by 3.
- `5*3**2` yields `45`.

Nevertheless, parentheses can be useful.

**Caution:** All operations must be explicitly stated. The code `(3+4)(5+6)` yields an error message. (Try it!) You must explicitly include the multiplication command: `(3+4)*(5+6)`.
