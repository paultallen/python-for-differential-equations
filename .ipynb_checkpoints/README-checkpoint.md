# Python for Differential Equations
This repository contains bits of python code for students in my Differential Equations course.
Please note:
- This is not in any way intended to be a systematic introduction to Python. For a systematic treatment of Python geared for scientific computation, I highly recommend [Learning Scientific Programming with Python by Christian Hill](https://scipython.com/about/the-book/).
- In many places, the code or approach is not 'optimal' or 'standard'. Often this is either because I wrote the code to fit the narrative of my courses, or because I am trying to keep things simple for my students. This is especially true in the plotting section, where I don't introduce the full power of `matplotlib`.
