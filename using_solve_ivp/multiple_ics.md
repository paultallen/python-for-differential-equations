# Multiple initial conditions

Consider the simple logistic model
$$\frac{dy}{dt} = y(1-y).$$
To explore the behavior of this model, we consider several different initial conditions and plot the corresponding solutions together:

In order to create this graphic, we first defined a function for the right side of the equation
```
def f(t,y):
    return y*(1-y)
```
and set the initial/ending times:
```
t0 = 0.0
tmax = 10
```
Then we define a list of initial conditions:
```
ic = [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3]
```
and applied `solve_ivp`:
```
soln = solve_ivp( f, [t0,tmax], ic, 
                 t_eval=np.linspace(t0, tmax, 1000)
```
The resulting object `soln` has two important parts:
- `soln.t` is the list of $t$ values for the numerical solutions
- `soln.y` is a 2d array of $y$ values, with row `k` corresponding to the numerical solution having initial condition `ics[k]`.

In order to plot all these solutions, we use a loop where the counter `k` ranges over the number of initial conditions.
We use `len(ics)` to compute the number of initial conditions.
Our plotting loop is
```
for k in range(len(ic)):
    plt.plot(soln.t, soln.y[k], 
             label='y(0) = {}'.format(ic[k]))
```
After this, we added labels to the axes, the title, etc.

## Full code
Earlier in the notebook/file/console you need:
```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp
```
Then the graphic above is generated by the following code:
```
def f(t,y):
    return y*(1-y)

# range of time values
t0 = 0.0
tmax = 10

# initial condition
ic = [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3]

soln = solve_ivp( f, [t0,tmax], ic, 
                 t_eval=np.linspace(t0, tmax, 1000)
                )
                 
for k in range(len(ic)):
    plt.plot(soln.t, soln.y[k], 
             label='y(0) = {}'.format(ic[k]))

plt.legend(title='Initial condition')
plt.xlabel('time $t$')
plt.ylabel('percent habitat occupied $y$')
plt.title('Numerical solutions for simple logistic model')
plt.ylim(0,1.4)
plt.show()
```
